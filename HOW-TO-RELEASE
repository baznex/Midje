THINGS TO CHECK BEFORE DEPLOYING:

* `lein multi deps; lein multi midje`

* uncomment the `:warn-on-reflection true` line in project.clj, and run `lein midje`
  to check for any reflection warning inadvertently added. (there will be warnings from
  libraries we use that we cannot remove)
  
* Check for any public vars that shouldn't be visible to users. Hide them.
  (map str (vals (ns-publics 'midje.sweet)))
