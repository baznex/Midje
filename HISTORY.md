1.3.2-SNAPSHOT
-------------
* throws now accepts any extending Throwable. For example, this now passes:
  (throw (NullPointerException.)) => (throws Exception)
* each item in the right hand side of =streams=> will evaluate lazily:
  (provided
     (volatile-fn) =streams=> [(throw (Exception.) (throw (Exception.)) :evaluates-succesfully] 
* new function midje.sweet/expose-testables will allow you to write facts against 
  functions defined with the metadata of ^{:testable true} [or ^:testable, 
  or #^testable depending on which Clojure version you're running] 
* Can now have prerequisites that throw Throwables using =throws=>
    (provided (foo) =throws=> (Exception.))
* Chatty checkers can destructure their single argument.                                           
* tabular no longer requires variables names to begin with '?'
* throws checker has been updated: args are now any combination, in
  any order of messages (or regexes), predicates, or 0 or 1 Throwable classes
* many more common syntax mistakes give helpful error messages
* prevented an infinite loop caused by ill-formed tabular facts
* fact doc-strings now show in report output
  i. nested facts show nested doc-strings
  ii. tabular's doc-string shows in a similar manner
* =stream=> prerequisites give helpful error messages when they run out of items to return
* removed reflection warnings


1.3.1 
---------
* Fix mysterious type conversion error in some cases
  when midje has to try really hard to guess the line number.

1.3.0
--------
* Supports Clojure 1.3
* Syntax coloring
   https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Colorizing
* Lazytest/autotest behavior
  https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Lein-midje
* Alternate format for metaconstants uses dashes instead of dots: ---mc---
  This is useful if the metaconstant is to represent a function.
* Now considers metaconstants with different numbers of dots
  to be the same. That is: `(fact (f ..x..) => ...x..)` has
  two instances of the same metaconstant.
* Partial prerequisites
  https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Partial-prerequisites
* Data prerequisites.
  https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Data-prerequisites
* Now works properly with aot-compilation. More properly, at least.
* Prevents you from overriding functions that the compiler inlines.

* =expands-to=> for testing macros (in a style derived from
  /Let Over Lambda/. (via Phil CalÃ§ado)
  https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Macros

1.2
--------
*   Lein-midje has been split off into a separate project.
*   defrecord-openly and deftype-openly allows the use of
    `provided` with protocol functions.   https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Prerequisites-and-protocols
*    You can now specify how often prerequisites should be
     called.   https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Specifying-call-counts
*    Tabular facts
   https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Tabular-facts
*    `fact` will now return true if all the checks succeed;  false otherwise.
*    Can use either Clojure 1.2.0 or 1.2.1
*    Plain functions within prerequisite arglists are now  implicitly wrapped with `exactly`.
*    Bugfix: `roughly` works when a single argument is negative.

1.1.1 
---------
* Background prerequisites are now scoped to facts. That  works better with let-bindings. (Issue 26)

1.1
--------
* Can defer individual checks in a fact with the =future=>  arrow.
  https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Future-facts
* Negating arrows in facts (=not=>)
  https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Negating-arrows
* Folded prerequisites are much more competent
  https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki/Folded-prerequisites
* Some improvement in error reporting.
* The #'roughly checker can be used for inexact numerical comparisons. 
* #'irrelevant is a synonym for #anything
* Line numbers are better reported for failures of very stripped-down forms (like (fact 1 => odd?)
* A prerequisite like (f 1) =streams=> [1 2 3] produces  the next value each time it's called.
* Issue warning when bare function is used in a prerequisite. Behavior will change in 1.2.
* Several ways to make checkers that can be used in prerequisites.

1.0.1
-------------
* Ben Mabey fix: eagerly preserve record types
* Extended-= and collection checkers have semantics for mixing maps and records.

1.0.0
----------------
* Allow, where unambiguous, collection checkers to have multiple element arguments:

      (f) => (just  1 2 3 ) ; same as..
      (f) => (just [1 2 3])

* Unexpected exceptions are displayed with a trimmed stack trace
       FAIL at (t_collection.clj:427)
           Expected: 33
             Actual: java.lang.Error: Oops!

* `lein midje` runs clojure.test deftests and integrates the results into the summary.

* `cake midje` does the same for Cake users.
